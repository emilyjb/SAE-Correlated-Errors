# SAE-Correlated-Errors
Small area estimation for the Fay-Herriot model in which the measurement error and sampling error are correlated

The code in this repository re-produces the simulation results. 

The file "unequalpsiMLflipped.R" is the main file that runs the simulation. 
The file "getoutputloopabc.R" gathers the output. 
The file "repestfuns.R" is sourced in the program "unequalpsiMLflipped.R"
