# SAE-Correlated-Errors
Small area estimation for the Fay-Herriot model in which the measurement error and sampling error are correlated

The code in this repository implements the simulations that compare alternative predictors for a small area model in which the sampling error in the response is correlated with the measurement error in the covariate. 

The file "unequalpsiMLflipped.R" is the main file that runs the simulation. 
The file "getoutputloopabc.R" gathers the output. 
The file "repestfuns.R" is sourced in the program "unequalpsiMLflipped.R"
